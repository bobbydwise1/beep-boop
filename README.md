# _Week 3 Friday Project Beep-Boop Converter using Arrays and Loops

#### _Create a Web App that takes a number from user input and returns a predetermined message._

#### By _**Robert Lee**_

## Description

_The expected behavior of the program is as follows:  The user inputs an integer, and the program output is a string that counts all the numbers from zero to the user's number.  A new string should be regenerated without having to hit the "Refresh" button on the web browser._

_The exceptions are:_

*_If any number contains the "0" character, the number is replaced with "Beep!"._

*_If any number contains the "1" character, the number is replaced with "Boop!"._

*_If a number is divisible by 3 (with no remainder), the number is replaced with "I'm sorry Dave.  I'm afraid I can't do that."_

## Specifications

_1.  Ask the user for a number input._

_2.  Check that the user's number is an integer, and greater than 0._

_3.  The program will need to ._

_4.  Find the next largest squared number beyond the string's new length._

_5.  Put the string into a new array that is the squre of the string's length._

_6.  Encrypt the string using the CryptoSquare method._

_7.  Show the final output back to the user._
